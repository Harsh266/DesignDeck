Tech Stack:

1. Frontend:
    o React.js: JavaScript library to build interactive user interfaces.
    o Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
    o React Router: For managing different pages (Home, Profile, Dashboard, etc.).
    o Axios: To make HTTP requests to the backend.
2. Backend:
    o Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
    o Express.js: Framework for handling HTTP requests.
    o MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user profiles, code snippets, and media.
    o Mongoose: To structure data and interact with MongoDB.
3. File Upload:
    o Cloudinary: For handling image and video uploads to the cloud.
    o Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads.
4. Code Preview:
    o React Live: For rendering live code previews of HTML, CSS, and JS.
5. Authentication:
    o JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For handling user authentication.

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. User Authentication (Login, Registration)
    • Frontend: Build login and registration pages using React and Tailwind CSS.Use Axios to send requests to the backend for authentication.
    • Backend: Use JWT tokens for authentication. Send a token to the client for storing in local storage.
2. User Profile Creation
    • Profile page where users can upload their HTML, CSS, and JS code. Use React state to handle code inputs and file uploads.
3. Handling File Uploads (Images & Videos)
    • Use Cloudinary for media storage. On the frontend, send media (images, videos) to Cloudinary via Axios.
    • Store the media URLs in MongoDB.
4. Code Previews
    • Use React Live to render code previews for HTML, CSS, and JS. Pass the code from the user to the live editor to preview it in real time.
5. Database Design (MongoDB)
    • Users Collection: Store user details like username, email, profile picture, code snippets (HTML, CSS, JS), and media URLs.
    • Code Collection: Separate collection for storing code snippets and their previews.
6. Displaying Code Previews and Media
    • Display code previews using React Live and embed images and videos from Cloudinary on the dashboard or profile page.
7. Real-time Updates (Optional)
    • Use Socket.io for real-time updates to reflect code or media changes instantly
